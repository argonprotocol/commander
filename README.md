# Argon Commander

Argon Commander is a desktop application that helps you interact with the [Argon](https://argon.network) mainchain.
Among the core activities are:

- **Mining**: Argon is a proof-of-authorized-work blockchain. Use Argon Commander to mine Argon tokens.
- **Liquid Locking** Secure Bitcoins into Vaults to unlock the equivalent Argon liquidity.
- **Run a Vault** Run a vault. Earn interest by collateralizing Bitcoin Locks.

## Features

### Mining

Become an Argon Miner, even if you don't know have the technical background to manage a server.

The workflow will help you:

- Provision a mining machine (current providers are [`Digital Ocean`, `Custom Servers`, `Local Docker`])
- Calculate a profitable "bid" amount
- Configure a bidding "bot" to win 1 or more mining seats
- Monitor your bids and earnings

### Vaults

Vaults provide collateralization security to Bitcoin Lockers. As a Vault operator, you are able to set the APR per Argon
for Bitcoin Locks, as well as the percent you're willing to share with Treasury Pool providers (for more details, refer
to the Argon documentation amd white-papers).

Activities:

- Create a Vault
- Cosign Bitcoin Lock release-requests
- Monitor Treasury Pool returns
- Liquid Lock BTC in your Vault

#### Testing Vaults
You can run the docker-compose file that's in the mainchain repository to access bitcoin liquidity to test with (locally). Running this yarn command will download the latest docker-compose from the argon mainchain repository and start it up:

```bash
yarn docker:up
```
.. This will start bitcoin, a miner, a pricing oracle, and an "esplora" explorer that Commander uses to track your bitcoin transactions.

You will need the following commands to run against the cli locally:

```bash
# Send bitcoin to the cosign address (replace with your address/amount)
yarn docker:btc sendtoaddress bcrt1qwyf38ct4yzdd4vqfwa0mtr2qw49n62y8me970737nfea3a7asmhqjcwjfc 0.00039045

# Get a destination address for released bitcoin
yarn docker:btc getnewaddress

# Broadcast the released bitcoin
yarn docker:btc sendrawtransaction 020000000001016aa1e38d96312ee99386a13c443bcc38e2c8cb84d55ed779d62...

# Check the status of the bitcoin transaction
yarn docker:btc gettransaction 020000000001016aa1e38d96312ee99386a13c443bcc38e2c8cb84d55ed779d62...

```

Now you'll want to run Commander with the environment variable `ARGON_NETWORK_NAME=dev-docker` to connect to the local docker instance.

## Installation
